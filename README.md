# 🧱📚 Block Bookmarks
Simple tool for easier site navigation in the steam overlay web browser. I created it so that i don't have to google up the site i wanted to go to every time i launch the overlay.

## 🛠 Setup
1. Open up Steam settings
2. Head to the "Web browser" section
3. Change the web browser homepage URL to https://fancybaguette.github.io/block-bookmarks/

**❗ If you're in-game this requires restarting the game to see the change ❗**

## 📖 Usage
Once you've set it up it doesn't really need explanation on how to use it
### - Use the "Add a new bookmark" menu to add a new bookmark
Entering the bookmark's URL is required. You're also given the option to enter the bookmark's title although it isn't required. If you don't provide the title, the previously entered URL becomes the title.
### - Use the "Manage bookmarks" menu to edit and remove bookmarks
In the *Manage bookmarks* menu you can edit the URL and the title of a specific bookmark or remove it
### - Use the "Wipe all bookmarks" menu to permamently remove all of the current bookmarks
The *Wipe all bookmarks* menu allows you to, as the name suggests, remove all of your bookmarks in a single click. You can of course also remove them one by one in the *Manage bookmarks* menu.
