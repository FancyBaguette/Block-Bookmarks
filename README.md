# üìö Block Bookmarks

Simple tool intended for easier site navigation in the Steam overlay web browser. I created it so that i don't have to google up the site i wanted to go to every time i launch the overlay and so that you don't have to do it too. It's a very simple app thanks to which i practiced my javascript skills, mainly working with the local storage.

## üõ† Setup
1. Open up Steam settings
2. Head to the "Web browser" section
3. Change the web browser homepage URL to `https://fancybaguette.github.io/block-bookmarks/`

**‚ùó If you're in-game this requires restarting the game to see the change ‚ùó**

## üìñ Usage
Every time you'll click "WEB BROWSER" in the Steam overlay or open a new tab in a already open overlay web browser, the app will show up. Here's a quick rundown on all of the **currently available** features:
### - Use the "Add a new bookmark" menu to add a new bookmark
Entering the bookmark's URL is required. You're also given the option to enter the bookmark's title although it's optional. If you don't provide the title, the previously entered URL becomes the title.
### - Use the "Manage bookmarks" menu to edit and remove bookmarks
In the *Manage bookmarks* menu you can edit the URL and the title of a specific bookmark or remove it. You can also wipe **all** of the bookmarks at once, using the 'Wipe all' menu.
### - Use the "App settings" menu to customize the app
Change between dark and light theme and pick the preffered accent color in the *App settings* menu.

## üêû Troubleshooting
- If the icons don't load it's probably something to do with your browser's privacy settings and/or extensions. Make sure to check the console.
