Simple tool for easier site navigation in the steam overlay web browser. I created it so that i don't have to google up the site i wanted to go to every time i launch the overlay.

## Usage
**Setup**
1. Open up Steam settings
2. Head to the "Web browser" section
3. Change the web browser homepage URL to https://fancybaguette.github.io/block-bookmarks/

If you're in-game this requires restarting the game to see the change

**From there usage is really straightforward**
