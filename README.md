# üß±üìö Block Bookmarks
Simple tool intended for easier site navigation in the Steam overlay web browser. I created it so that i don't have to google up the site i wanted to go to every time i launch the overlay and so that you don't have to do it too.

## üõ† Setup
1. Open up Steam settings
2. Head to the "Web browser" section
3. Change the web browser homepage URL to https://fancybaguette.github.io/block-bookmarks/

**‚ùó If you're in-game this requires restarting the game to see the change ‚ùó**

## üìñ Usage
Every time you'll click "WEB BROWSER" in the Steam overlay or open a new tab in a already open overlay web browser the app will show up. Here's a quick rundown on the features:
### - Use the "Add a new bookmark" menu to add a new bookmark
Entering the bookmark's URL is required. You're also given the option to enter the bookmark's title although it's optional. If you don't provide the title, the previously entered URL becomes the title.
### - Use the "Manage bookmarks" menu to edit and remove bookmarks
In the *Manage bookmarks* menu you can edit the URL and the title of a specific bookmark or remove it
### - Use the "Wipe all bookmarks" menu to permamently remove all of the current bookmarks
The *Wipe all bookmarks* menu allows you to, as the name suggests, remove all of your bookmarks in a single click. You can of course also remove them one by one in the *Manage bookmarks* menu.

A **Bookmark block** consists of the Bookmark's title and the bookmarked websites icon. If the icon fails to load it's replaced with a simple icon.
